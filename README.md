1. Write an R program to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division) on two user inputs. 
2. Using a dataset of your choice, calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation 
of a numeric column. 
3. Write a program in R to determine if a number is even or odd using conditional 
statements. 
4. Split the data into training and test sets and evaluate the classification accuracy. 
5. Implement a loop in R that prints the square of numbers from 1 to 10. 
6. Build a Naive Bayes classifier using the iris dataset and display the confusion 
matrix. 
7. Create a vector of 10 numbers in R and find the maximum, minimum, and mean. 
8. Write a bubble sort function in R to sort a vector in ascending order. 
9. Load a CSV file into R and handle missing values by replacing them with the column 
mean. 
10.  Implement linear search in R and test it on a vector of integers. 
11. Convert a categorical column into factors and display its summary  
12. Using the iris dataset, implement a decision tree classifier and display the decision 
rules. 
13.  Visualize the decision tree and evaluate its accuracy using a confusion matrix. 
14. Use the iris dataset to implement the KNN algorithm with k=3. 
15. What assumptions does the Naive Bayes classifier make? Test whether these 
assumptions hold for the dataset you used. 
16. Plot the regression line on a scatter plot. 
17.   Generate a boxplot for a numerical column and explain what it shows about the 
data. 
18. Compare the performance of bubble sort with Râ€™s built-in sort function for a vector 
of 1000 random numbers. 
19.  Write a function in R that takes a number as input and returns its factorial. 
20. Build a Naive Bayes classifier using the iris dataset and display the confusion 
matrix.
